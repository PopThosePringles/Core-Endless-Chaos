Name: "Endless Chaos"
Description: "A game made in a few hours for the \"TO THE MOON\" 48hr game Jam.\r\n\r\nIt\'s very rushed as I was late to the party, so it\'s likely buggy.  It\'s also an open project, and on GitHub if you want to see how it was made.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/PopThosePringles/Core-Endless-Chaos"
